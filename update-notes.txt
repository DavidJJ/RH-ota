2.2.5 and higher

If you performed an update from 2.2.4 version or previous and you want to use custom pins as reset pins:

Add a following line to the updater-config.json file:

	"pins_assignment" : "custom"

So the file looks like this:

{
	"pi_user" : (...),
	"RH_version" : (...),
	"debug_user" : (...),
	"country" : (...),
	"nodes_number" : (...),
	"debug_mode" : 0,
	"pins_assignment" : "custom"
}

!!! Remember about adding "," sign to the end of the previous line.

And than edit lines 60 to 67 in nodes_update.py file.

nano nodes_update.py

The default file that you can check so you have an example is 'distr-updater-config.json'.

Thanks! Happy flyin'!
