For using this software you have to have SPI bus (SPI1 - second one) pins of the Raspberry Pi connected to SPI pins of your Arduinos.

Pins MISO, MOSI, SCK should be connected to all Arduinos - parallelly. Pins "reset" of Arduinos should be connected to specific pins

on the Raspberry. You can change those pins to any unused general purpose pins from the GPIO header if you want. After that, 

remember to change assignment of the pins in the update.py file accordingly. 


You can change username to match one that you use on the Raspberry, by opening update.py file in text editor - use 'nano update.py'.
