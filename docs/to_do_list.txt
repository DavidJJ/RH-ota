        To do list:
        
1. AVRdude test - test the connection with simple 'avrdude -p -v' etc.
2. Screen center content showing - python 3 related - we want it?
3. Nodes update as function - done (in .dev dir), testing
5. Mentioning contributors in instruction and on the project page
6. Confirm that logging is 100% reliable - need testing, transfer.sh has many flaws
7. Implement new way of node resetting - IMPORTANT!! (Michael FPV)
8. AP / WiFi client auto-switching - David's request, Roger's issue?
9. Implement easy python 3 conversion for existing users - just for RotorHazard when will be done
10. Starting/installing script - easy, 95% done
11. After implementing i2c - clean the directories etc.
12. Is using flags ok? capital letters?
13. One parser file type
14. Make technical stuff like installing avrdude and enabling serial more user friendly - script
with simple naming like 'configure hardware' not 'install avrdude'
15. Add i2c showing: i2cdetect -y 1
