        To do list:
        
1. AVRdude test - test the connection with simple 'avrdude -p -v' etc.
2. Screen center content showing - python 3 related - we want it?
3. Nodes update as function - done (in .dev dir), testing
5. Mentioning contributors in instruction and on the project page
6. Confirm that logging is 100% reliable - need testing, transfer.sh has many flaws
7. Implement new way of node resetting - IMPORTANT!! (Michael FPV)
8. AP / WiFi client auto-switching - David's request, Roger's issue?
9. Implement easy python 3 conversion for existing users
10. Starting/installing script - easy, 95% done (add python3-gpiozero and cowsay to it?)
11. After implementing i2c - clean the directories etc.

# todo - just so we have a reminder of this list
