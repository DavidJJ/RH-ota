For using this software you have to have SPI (spi1 - second one) pins of the Raspberry pi connected to spi pins of your Arduinos.

Pins MISO, MOSI, SCK should be connected to all Arduinos - parallelly. Pins "reset" of Arduinos should be connected to specific pins

on the Raspberry. You can change those pins to any unused general purpose pins from the GPIO header. After that, remember to changes 

assignment of the pins in the update.py file accordingly.
