		Right now you have your Access Point configured. However,
		there is still an option to mantain internet connection.
		You will be able to connect the Pi via ethernet to the router 
		or PC - with internet sharing option enbled. It requires chages
		in configuration file. Those will be performed automatically,
		after entering 'netcfg' or 'apcfg' in command line.
		Remember to reboot the timer after every change. Instruction
		can be also found in 'apconf.txt' file in net_ap folder.

		Remember that regardless how you have your Raspberry configured
		in a given moment, you can always connect to it using WiFi.
		It can be helpful if you don't remember how your timer was configured
		when you left it or when some troubleshooting is required.

		Open second page, for detailed explanation.

		When Raspberry configuration has been changed so it performs
		as Access Point or as a DHCP client (normal mode),
		configuration file is being copied with a proper name.
		Next you have to reboot, so changes can be applied.
		When you setup Pi as a client, you can just connect
		it to the router. If you are using PC as a internet sharing
		device, you have to enable that option in OS settings.
		Instructions for Windows can be found in net_ap folder.
		
		If you want to connect to Raspberry via SSH or VNC,
		when it's in client mode you have to know its IP address.
		Check it in router settings page or using special program 
		'Advanced IP Scanner' on a PC. If you are using Pi as a AP, 
		its IP is always 172.20.20.20 (ethernet). Remember to disable
		internet sharing functionality on your PC's OS, when Raspberry
		is in Access Point mode. 

		Remember that you can always connect to the timer (eg. from yet 
		another device) via WiFi. It's wireless IP is 10.10.10.10.
