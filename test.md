* JSON API to retrieve timing data from other systems

## Hardware and Software Setup
To build and configure the system, follow the instructions here:<br />
[doc/Hardware Setup.md](doc/Hardware%20Setup.md)<br />
[doc/Software Setup.md](doc/Software%20Setup.md)

An easy-to-build single node version of RotorHazard may also be constructed -- see [doc/USB Nodes.md](doc/USB%20Nodes.md) for more info.

**Note:** The 'master' branch in the GitHub repository will usually contain the latest development code, which may not be stable. To install the latest stable release, please follow the instructions in the [doc/Software Setup.md](doc/Software%20Setup.md) document (for version upgrading see the '[Updating an existing installation](doc/Software%20Setup.md#update)' section at the end).

## User Guide
For initial setup and running races, follow these instructions: [doc/User Guide.md](doc/User%20Guide.md)

## Migrating from/to Delta5
RotorHazard uses the same hardware, but different code for the nodes. Re-flash your Arduinos as in the [setup instructions](doc/Software%20Setup.md#receiver-nodes-arduinos) whenever you switch between the two projects.

## Additional Resources
Links to external resources are available from the [Wiki](https://github.com/RotorHazard/RotorHazard/wiki), including extended tutorials, video content, and a Raspberry Pi setup/install/upgrade/node flashing tool.
