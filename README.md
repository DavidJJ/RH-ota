		

		Hello! You are using tool designed to easy uploadig the firmware on the RotorHazard racetimer nodes.

		For now consider this tool as a beta verision. Tests are being done constantly.




		Files that you are about to flash are 'hex' files from an official RotorHazard Arduino nodes ino files.

		After using this tool nodes would be flashed WITHOUT the bootloader which means,

		that you won't be capable of connecting your Arduinos to the usb port and using it with PC anymore,

		unless you flash bootloader back using 'Advanced menu' of this software.




		It is recommended to flash nodes with specfic file for every node, even with 'autoselection mod'.

		This way you can allways check if nodes were flashed correctly during manual boot of the server file

		- what smartass would do after flashing new firmware anyway.



		If you are using this tool for the first time enter 'Advanced menu' and select 'Install avrdude'.

		For more hardware instructions open 'manuals' file or visit Facebook page.



				Enjoy!											Szafran
