	If you want to use another version than 'master' or you use another username than 'pi', 
	open the py file and change those accordingly at the top of the file. 
	
	Remember that current 'master' version can be in beta so check out latest release page:
	https://github.com/RotorHazard/RotorHazard/releases and look for "Latest release" version,
	with green box or just use 'master' version if you want to use the newest possible version.
